I am a senior undergraduate student from Department of Computer Science, [Zhejiang University of Technology](https://www.zjut.edu.cn). My research interest now is in 3D Gaussian Splatting and Diffusion Model. I also participated in some researches related to Large Language Model, neural architecture search and neural backdoor mitigation. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Sixian Chan](https://homepage.zjut.edu.cn/csx/) of Computer Vision Lab from Department of Computer Science, Zhejiang University of Technology. I was a research assistant in [Zhejiang Lab](https://www.zhejianglab.org/lab/home), China. Now I am a research assistant in [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/zh/?variant=zh-cn) supervised by [Prof. Hao Wang](https://wanghao.tech).
