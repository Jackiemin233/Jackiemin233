I am a research assistant in [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/zh/?variant=zh-cn) supervised by [Prof. Hao Wang](https://wanghao.tech).

Before this, I obtained my B.S. from Department of Computer Science and Jianxing Honors College, [Zhejiang University of Technology](https://www.zjut.edu.cn) under the supervision of [Prof. Sixian Chan](https://homepage.zjut.edu.cn/csx/) of Computer Vision Lab. My research interest now is in 3D Gaussian Splatting and Diffusion Model. I also participated in some researches related to Large Language Models, Neural Architecture Search and neural backdoor mitigation. I was a research assistant in [Zhejiang Lab](https://www.zhejianglab.org/lab/home). I also conduct remote cooperation with [Prof. Zhengzhong Tu](https://vztu.github.io) at [TA&MU](https://www.tamu.edu) on human video generation.
