======

I'm a senior undergraduate student from Department of Computer Science, [Zhejiang University of Technology](https://www.zjut.edu.cn). My research interest now is in 3D Gaussian Splatting and Diffusion Model. I also participated in some works related to Large Language Model and neural backdoor mitigation. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Sixian Chan](https://homepage.zjut.edu.cn/csx/) of Computer Science Lab from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Zhejiang University of Technology. I was an research assistant in Zhejiang Lab, China. Now I am a research assistant in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) supervised by [Prof. Hao Wang](https://wanghao.tech).
